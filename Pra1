1.Write a program which will read temperaturevalue in Fahrenheit scale and print the value in Celsius scale.

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    float C,F;
    printf("Enter the Celsius to convert it in Fahrenheit: ");
    scanf("%f",&F);

    C = (F - 32) * 5/9;
    printf("%.2f",C);

}

2.Write a program to enter length and width of arectangle and find area and perimeter of the rectangle.

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int l,b,area,perimeter;
    printf("Enter length of rectangle : ");
    scanf("%d",&l);
    printf("\nEnter breadth of rectangle : ");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    area=l*b;
    perimeter=2*(l+b);

    printf("\nArea of the rectangle is %d\n",area);
    printf("\nPerimeter of rectangle is%d\n",perimeter);

}

3.Write a program to enter marks of five subjects of a student and calculate total, average and percentage of all subjects.

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int S1,S2,S3,S4,S5,percentage,total;
    // 
    printf("\nEnter the marks Out of 100");
    printf("\nEnter the marks of Science: ");
    scanf("%d",&S1);
    printf("\nEnter the marks of Maths: ");
    scanf("%d",&S2);
    printf("\nEnter the marks of English: ");
    scanf("%d",&S3);
    printf("\nEnter the marks of Hindi: ");
    scanf("%d",&S4);
    printf("\nEnter the marks of Computer: ");
    scanf("%d",&S5);

    total = S1 + S2 + S3 + S4 + S5;
    printf("\nThe Total Marks are %d",total);
    percentage = (total*100)/500;
    printf("\nThe Percentage is %d",percentage);

}


4.Write four statements by using printf function to print an asterisk pattern having 1, 3,5 and 7 asterisks (*) in successive lines so that it generates a triangular pattern as given below.

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i, j;
    for (i = 1; i <= 7; i += 2) {
        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            printf("*");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}


5.A ball is released from a height of Y meters. Each time it bounces on the floor, its velocity becomes halved. Write a program, which reads the value of Y and prints the total distance 
traversed by the ball when it touches the ground for the third time. Assumethat the value of acceleration due to gravity, g, is 9.8.

#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    double Y, totalDistance = 0;
    const double g = 9.8; // acceleration due to gravity

    // Input the initial height
    printf("Enter the initial height (in meters): ");
    scanf("%lf", &Y);

    // Calculate the total distance for three bounces
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        // Distance covered during free fall
        totalDistance += Y;

        // Calculate the velocity after bouncing
        double velocityAfterBounce = 0.5 * g;

        // Calculate the height after bouncing
        Y *= 0.5;

        // Distance covered during the bounce
        totalDistance += Y;

        // Update the height for the next bounce
        Y *= 0.5;
    }

    printf("Total distance traversed by the ball after three bounces: %.2f meters\n", totalDistance);

    return 0;
}

6.Consider a bank that offers fixed deposit accounts with cumulative (annually) interest on the balance available in the account. Write a C program that reads the amount initially invested (called
Principal amount) in an account and interest rate. The program generates the balanceavailable in the account at the end of each year for first five years.

#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    double principalAmount, interestRate, balance;

    // Input the principal amount
    printf("Enter the principal amount: ");
    scanf("%lf", &principalAmount);

    // Input the interest rate
    printf("Enter the interest rate (in percentage): ");
    scanf("%lf", &interestRate);

    // Convert interest rate to decimal
    interestRate /= 100;

    // Display the header
    printf("\nYear\tBalance\n");

    // Calculate and display the balance for the first five years
    for (int year = 1; year <= 5; year++) {
        // Calculate the balance at the end of the year
        balance = principalAmount * (1 + interestRate);

        // Display the year and balance
        printf("%d\t%.2f\n", year, balance);

        // Update principal amount for the next year
        principalAmount = balance;
    }

    return 0;
}
